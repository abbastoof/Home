# Hello there! 👋  
I'm Pooria, a passionate software developer with over **7 years of experience** as a **Network Engineer**. After completing my core studies at **Hive Helsinki**, part of the **42 school network**, I transitioned into software development, where I’ve built a solid foundation in **C, C++, Python, Django, FastAPI**, and **microservices architecture**.

## 🚀 My Proudest Projects:
- 🔥 **[Transcendence](https://github.com/abbastoof/transcendence)** – A multiplayer game project where I implemented **microservices architecture** with **Django REST Framework** and integrated real-time communication using **WebSockets**.
- 🔥 **[Delivery Fee Calculator](https://github.com/abbastoof/Delivery_Fee_Calculator)** – Developed using **FastAPI**, dynamically calculating delivery fees based on multiple parameters.
- 🔥 **[FT_IRC](https://github.com/abbastoof/FT_IRC)** – An IRC server built in **C++**, focusing on network communication protocols and handling real-time data.
- 🔥 **[Cub3D](https://github.com/abbastoof/Cub3D)** – A 3D game engine project built in **C**, using **MiniLibX**, involving rendering of a maze using raycasting.
- 🔥 **[PhoenixShell](https://github.com/abbastoof/PhoenixShell)** – A custom shell developed in **C** with support for process management, pipes, redirection, and built-in commands, designed to mimic the functionality of a real Linux shell while enhancing error handling and user experience.
- 🔥 **[LittleLemon_Website](https://github.com/abbastoof/LittleLemon_Website)** – A dynamic web application built using **Django**, focused on managing restaurant orders, table reservations, and customer feedback.
