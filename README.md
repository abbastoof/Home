# Hello there! üëã
---

My name is Abbas Toof, but please call me **Pooria**. I am a software developer interested in Machine Learning and embedded systems. With over 7 years of experience as a Network Engineer, I have a strong background in networking.

I am skilled in C, C++, Python, Django, and FastAPI, and have experience working with Unix-like systems and Docker. While studying at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/), part of the well-known [42 coding school](https://www.42.fr/), I worked on many projects that improved my technical and teamwork skills. These experiences have helped me grow as a developer, making me better at solving problems and creating solutions.

I am confident that I can add value to your projects and am excited to work on new and innovative technology. I enjoy working in teams, especially those spread across different parts of the world, and look forward to bringing my skills to new challenges.
